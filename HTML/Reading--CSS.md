###**Styles  with 'font' and 'text' affecting rules, with examples!**

----
####1
**font**
The font CSS property is either a shorthand property for setting font-style, font-variant, font-weight, font-size, line-height and font-family, or a way to set the element's font to a system font, using specific keywords.

As with any shorthand CSS properties, the values which are not set in it are set to their individual initial values, eventually overriding values previously set using non-shorthand properties.

Values -
<'font-style'>
<'font-variant'>
<'font-weight'>
<'font-size'>
<'line-height'>
<'font-family'>
Examples:
```css
p { font: 12px/14px sans-serif }
```
```css
p { font: 80% sans-serif }
```
```css
p { font: bold italic large serif }
```

----
####2
**font-family**
The font-family CSS property allows for a prioritized list of font family names and/or generic family names to be specified for the selected element. Unlike most other CSS properties, values are separated by a comma to indicate that they are alternatives. The browser will select the first font on the list that is installed on the computer, or that can be downloaded using the information provided by a @font-face at-rule.

Web authors should always add at least one generic family in a font-family list, since there's no guarantee that a specific font is installed on the computer or can be downloaded using a @font-face at-rule. The generic family lets the browser select an acceptable fallback font when needed.

It is often convenient to use the shorthand property font to set font-size and other font related properties all at once.
Values -

`<family-name>`
The name of a font family. For example, "Times" and "Helvetica" are font families. Font family names containing whitespace should be quoted.

`<generic-name>`
Generic font families are a fallback mechanism, a means of preserving some of the style sheet author's intent in case when none of the specified fonts are available. Generic family names are keywords and must not be quoted. A generic font family should be the a last alternative in the list of font family names.

`serif`
Glyphs have finishing strokes, flared or tapering ends, or have actual serifed endings.
E.g.  Palatino, "Palatino Linotype", Palladio, "URW Palladio", serif
`sans-serif`
Glyphs have stroke endings that are plain.
E.g. 'Trebuchet MS', 'Liberation Sans', 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif
`monospace`
All glyphs have the same fixed width.
E.g. "DejaVu Sans Mono", Menlo, Consolas, "Liberation Mono", Monaco, "Lucida Console", monospace
`cursive`
Glyphs in cursive fonts generally have either joining strokes or other cursive characteristics beyond those of italic typefaces. The glyphs are partially or completely connected, and the result looks more like handwritten pen or brush writing than printed letterwork.
`fantasy`
Fantasy fonts are primarily decorative fonts that contain playful representations of characters.
Examples:
```css
{ font-family: "Gill Sans Extrabold", Helvetica, sans-serif }
```
```css
{ font-family: Courier, "Lucida Console", monospace }
```
```css
{   font-family: fantasy; }
```

----
####3
**font-size**
The font-size CSS property specifies the size of the font â€“ specifically the desired height of glyphs from the font. Setting the font size may, in turn, change the size of other items, since it is used to compute the value of em and ex length units.
Values-
xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large
A set of absolute size keywords based on the user's default font size (which is medium). Similar to presentational HTML's `<font size="1">` through `<font size="7">` where the user's default font size is `<font size="3">`.
larger, smaller
Larger or smaller than the parent element's font size, by roughly the ratio used to separate the absolute size keywords above.
`<length>`
A positive `<length>`. When the units are specified in em or ex, the size is defined relative to the size of the font on the parent element of the element in question. For example, 0.5em is half the font size of the parent of the current element.
`<percentage>`
A positive `<percentage>` of the parent element's font size.
It is best to use values that are relative to the user's default font size, and avoid absolute values such as lengths with units other than em or ex. However, if such absolute values must be used, px are preferred over other units because their meaning does not vary depending on what the operating system thinks (generally incorrectly) the resolution of the monitor is.
Examples:
```css
p {  font-size: 1.6em; /* 1.6em = 16px */}
```
```css
h1 { font-size: 250% }
```
```css
.point {
	font-size: 24pt;
```

----
####4
**font-weight**
The font-weight CSS property specifies the weight or boldness of the font. However, some fonts are not available in all weights; some are available only on normal and bold.
Values-
`normal`
Normal font weight. Same as 400.
`bold`
Bold font weight. Same as 700.
`lighter`
One font weight lighter than the parent element (among the available weights of the font).
`bolder`
One font weight darker than the parent element (among the available weights of the font).
`100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900`
Numeric font weights for fonts that provide more than just normal and bold. If the exact weight given is unavailable, then 600-900 use the closest available darker weight (or, if there is none, the closest available lighter weight), and 100-500 use the closest available lighter weight (or, if there is none, the closest available darker weight). This means that for fonts that provide only normal and bold, 100-500 are normal, and 600-900 are bold.
Examples:
```css
p { font-weight: bold; }
```
```css
h1 { font-weight: 500; }
```
```css
span { font-weight: lighter; }
```

----
####5
**font-variant**
The font-variant CSS property selects a normal, or small-caps face from a font family. Setting the CSS Level 2 (Revision 1) values of the  font-variant property, that is normal or small-caps, is also possible by using the `font` shorthand.

This property acts as a shorthand and, when set, resets the unspecified values of the longhand properties: `font-variant-caps`, `font-variant-numeric`, `font-variant-alternates`, `font-variant-ligatures`, and `font-variant-east-asian`.
Values -
`normal`
Specifies a normal font face; each of the longhand properties has an initial value of normal. Longhand properties of font-variant are: `font-variant-caps`, `font-variant-numeric`, `font-variant-alternates`, `font-variant-ligatures`, and `font-variant-east-asian`.
`none`
Sets the value of the font-variant-ligatures to none and the values of the other longhand property as normal, their initial value.
`<common-lig-values>`, `<discretionary-lig-values>`, `<historical-lig-values>`, `<contextual-alt-values>`
Specifies the keywords related to the font-variant-ligatures longhand property. The possible values are: common-ligatures, no-common-ligatures, discretionary-ligatures, no-discretionary-ligatures, historical-ligatures, no-historical-ligatures, contextual, and no-contextual.
`stylistic()`,  `historical-forms`, `styleset()`, `character-variant()`, `swash()`, `ornaments()`, `annotation()`
Specifies the keywords and functions related to the font-variant-alternates longhand property.
`small-caps, all-small-caps, petite-caps, all-petite-caps, unicase, titling-caps`
Specifies the keywords and functions related to the font-variant-caps longhand property.
`<numeric-figure-values>`, `<numeric-spacing-values>`, `<numeric-fraction-values>`, `ordinal`, `slashed-zero`
Specifies the keywords related to the font-variant-numeric longhand property. The possible values are:  lining-nums, oldstyle-nums, proportional-nums, tabular-nums, diagonal-fractions, stacked-fractions, ordinal, and slashed-zero.
`<east-asian-variant-values>`, `<east-asian-width-values>`, ruby
Specifies the keywords related to the font-variant-east-asian longhand property. The possible values are: jis78, jis83, jis90, jis04, simplified, traditional, full-width, proportional-width, ruby.
Examples:
```css
p {  font-variant: small-caps; }
```
```css
div {    font-variant:normal;  }
```
```css
div {    font-variant:initial; }
```

----
####6
**text-align**
The text-align CSS property describes how inline content like text is aligned in its parent block element. text-align does not control the alignment of block elements itself, only their inline content.
Values -
`start`
The same as left if direction is left-to-right and right if direction is right-to-left.
`end`
The same as right if direction is left-to-right and left if direction is right-to-left.
`left`
The inline contents are aligned to the left edge of the line box.
`right`
The inline contents are aligned to the right edge of the line box.
`center`
The inline contents are centered within the line box.
`<string>`
The first occurrence of the one-char string is the element used for alignment. the keyword that follows or precedes it indicates how it is aligned. This allows to align numeric values on the decimal point, for instance.
`justify`
The text is justified. Text should line up their left and right edges to the left and right content edges of the paragraph.
`match-parent`
Similar to inherit with the difference that the value start and end are calculated according the parent's direction and are replaced by the adequate left or right value.
Examples:
```css
div { text-align: center; border:solid; }
```
```css
div { text-align: center; border:solid; }
```
```css
div { text-align:-moz-center; text-align:-webkit-center; border:solid; }
```

----
####7
**text-decoration**
The text-decoration CSS property is used to set the text formatting to underline, overline, line-through or blink.

Underline and overline decorations are positioned under the text, line-through over it.
Values-
Accepts one or more whitespace separated values:

`none`
Produces no text decoration.
`underline`
Each line of text is underlined.
`overline`
Each line of text has a line above it.
`line-through`
Each line of text has a line through the middle.
`blink`
Is a keyword making the text slowlyblinks. Though valid, the effect is deprecated and the specification allows browser to ignore this value. Note that not blinking the text is one technique to satisfy checkpoint 3.3 of WAI-UAAG.
`-moz-anchor-decoration`
Mozilla CSS Extension, not suitable for web content.
Examples:
```css
h1.under {   text-decoration: underline; }
```
```css
p.blink {  text-decoration: blink; }
```
```css
p.underover {  text-decoration: underline overline; }
```

----
####8
**text-indent**
The text-indent CSS property specifies how much horizontal space should be left before the beginning of the first line of the text content of an element. Horizontal spacing is with respect to the left (or right, for right-to-left layout) edge of the containing block element's box.
Values -
`<length>`
Indentation is specified as an absolute `<length>`. Negative values are allowed. See `<length>` values for possible units.
`<percentage>`
Indentation is a `<percentage>` of the containing block width.
`each-line`
Indentation affects the first line of the block container as well as each line after a forced line break , but does not affect lines after a soft wrap break .
`hanging`
Inverts which lines are indented. All lines except the first line will be indented.
Examples:
```css
p {   text-indent: 5em;
  background: powderblue;}
```
```css
p {   text-indent: 30%;
  background: plum; }
```
```css
p {  text-indent: 50px;}
```

----
####9
**text-overflow**
The text-overflow CSS property determines how overflowed content that is not displayed is signaled to the users. It can be clipped, or display an ellipsis ('â€¦', U+2026 HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS) or a Web author-defined string.
Clipping happens at the border of the box; to clip at the character limit an empty custom string can be used ('').

This property only affects content that is overflowing a block container element in its inline progression direction (not text overflowing at the bottom of a box, for example). Text can overflow when it is prevented from wrapping (e.g., due to â€˜white-space:nowrapâ€™) or a single word being too long to fit.

This CSS property doesn't force an overflow to occur; to do so and make text-overflow to be applied, the author must apply some additional properties on the element, like setting overflow to hidden.
Values -
`clip`
This keyword value indicates to truncate the text at the limit of the content area, therefore the truncation can happen in the middle of a character. To truncate at the transition between two characters, the empty string value ('') must be used. The value clip is the default for this property.
`ellipsis`
This keyword value indicates to display an ellipsis ('â€¦', U+2026 HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS) to represent clipped text. The ellipsis is displayed inside the content area, decreasing the amount of text displayed. If there is not enough space to display the ellipsis, it is clipped.
`<string>`
The `<string>` to be used to represent clipped text. The string is displayed inside the content area, shortening more the size of the displayed text. If there is not enough place to display the string itself, it is clipped.
Examples:
```css
p {
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;              /* "overflow" value must be different from "visible" */

  text-overflow:    ellipsis;
}
```
```css
#myDIV {
    overflow:hidden;
    text-overflow:clip;
}
```
```css
#myDIV {
    overflow:hidden;
    text-overflow:initial;
}
```

----
####10
**text-transform**
The text-transform CSS property specifies how to capitalize an element's text. It can be used to make text appear in all-uppercase or all-lowercase, or with each word capitalized.
Values -
`capitalize`
Is a keyword forcing the first letter of each word to be converted to uppercase. Other characters are unchanged; that is, they retain their original case as written in the element's text. A letter is any Unicode character part of the Letter or Number general categories  : it excludes any punctuation marks or symbols at the beginning of the word.
Authors should not expect capitalize to follow language-specific titlecasing conventions (such as skipping articles in English).
`uppercase`
Is a keyword forcing all characters to be converted to uppercase.
`lowercase`
Is a keyword forcing all characters to be converted to lowercase.
`none`
Is a keyword preventing the case of all characters to be changed.
`full-width`
Is a keyword forcing the writing of a character, mainly ideograms and latin scripts inside a square, allowing them to be aligned in the usual East Asian scripts (like Chinese or Japanese).
Examples:
```css
p { text-transform: capitalize; }
```
```css
p { text-transform: uppercase; }
```
```css
p { text-transform: lowercase; }
```

###**Styles that affect the color of things:**

----
####12
**background-color**
The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element, either through a color value or the keyword transparent.
Value(s) -
`<color>`
Is a CSS `<color>` that describes the uniform color of the background. Even if one or several background-image are defined, this color can be affect the rendering, by transparency if the images aren't opaque.

----
####11
**box-shadow**
The box-shadow CSS property describes one or more shadow effects as a comma-separated list. It allows casting a drop shadow from the frame of almost any element. If a border-radius is specified on the element with a box shadow, the box shadow takes on the same rounded corners. The z-ordering of multiple box shadows is the same as multiple text shadows (the first specified shadow is on top).
Value(s) -
inset
If not specified (default), the shadow is assumed to be a drop shadow (as if the box were raised above the content).
The presence of the inset keyword changes the shadow to one inside the frame (as if the content was depressed inside the box). Inset shadows are drawn inside the border (even transparent ones), above the background, but below content.
`<offset-x> <offset-y>`
These are two `<length>` values to set the shadow offset. `<offset-x>` specifies the horizontal distance. Negative values place the shadow to the left of the element. `<offset-y>` specifies the vertical distance. Negative values place the shadow above the element. See `<length>` for possible units.
If both values are 0, the shadow is placed behind the element (and may generate a blur effect if `<blur-radius>` and/or `<spread-radius>` is set).
`<blur-radius>`
This is a third `<length>` value. The larger this value, the bigger the blur, so the shadow becomes bigger and lighter. Negative values are not allowed. If not specified, it will be 0 (the shadow's edge is sharp).
`<spread-radius>`
This is a fourth `<length>` value. Positive values will cause the shadow to expand and grow bigger, negative values will cause the shadow to shrink. If not specified, it will be 0 (the shadow will be the same size as the element).
`<color>`
See <color> values for possible keywords and notations.
If not specified, the color used depends on the browser - it is usually the value of the color property, but note that Safari currently paints a transparent shadow in this case.

----
####10
**border-bottom-color**
The border-bottom-color CSS property sets the color of the bottom border of an element. Note that in many cases the shorthand CSS properties border-color or border-bottom are more convenient and preferable.
Values -
`<color>`
Is a `<color>` CSS value describing the color of the bottom border.
inherit
Is a keyword denoting the color of the bottom border of the parent's element (which may be different from the border-bottom-color default value)

----
####9
**border-left-color**
The border-left-color CSS property sets the color of the bottom border of an element. Note that in many cases the shorthand CSS properties border-color or border-left are more convenient and preferable.
Values -
`<color>`
Is a `<color>` CSS value describing the color of the left border.
inherit
Is a keyword denoting the color of the bottom border of the parent's element (which may be different from the border-left-color default value)

----
####8
**border-right-color**
The border-right-color CSS property sets the color of the right border of an element. Note that in many cases the shorthand CSS properties  border-color or border-right are more convenient and preferable.
Values -
`<color>`
Is a `<color>` CSS value describing the color of the right border.
inherit
Is a keyword denoting the color of the bottom border of the parent's element (which may be different from the border-right-color default value)

----
####7
**border-top-color**
The border-top-color CSS property sets the color of the top border of an element. Note that in many cases the shorthand CSS properties border-color or border-top are more convenient and preferable.
Values -
`<color>`
Is a `<color>` CSS value describing the color of the top border.
inherit
Is a keyword denoting the color of the top border of the parent's element (which may be different from the border-top-color default value)

----
####6
**color**
The CSS color property sets the foreground color of an element's text content, and its decorations. It doesn't affect any other characteristic of the element; it should really be called text-color and would have been named so, save for historical reasons and its appearance in CSS Level 1.

Note that the color value must be a uniform color, which may include a transparency value from CSS3 onwards. It can't be a `<gradient>` which is an `<image>` in CSS.
Values -
`<color>`
Is a `<color>` value giving the color of the textual elements of the element.

----
####5
**column-rule-color**
The column-rule-color CSS property lets you set the color of the rule drawn between columns in multi-column layouts.
Values -
`<color>`
Is a `<color>` value representing the color of the rule separating columns.

----
####4
**filter**
**EXPERIMENTAL**
The CSS filter property provides for effects like blurring or color shifting on an elementâ€™s rendering before the element is displayed. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of an image, a background, or a border.

Included in the CSS standard are several functions that achieve predefined effects. You can also reference a filter specified in SVG with a URL to an SVG filter element.

----
####3
**list-style-image**
The list-style-image CSS property sets the image that will be used as the list item marker.

It is often more convenient to use the shorthand list-style.
Values -
`<uri>`
Location of image to use as the marker.
none
Specifies that no image is used as the marker. If this value is set, the marker defined in list-style-type will be used instead.

----
####2
**outline-color**
The outline-color CSS property sets the color of the outline of an element. An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the border edge, to make the element stand out.
Values -
`<color>`
See `<color>` for the various color keywords and notations.
invert
To ensure the outline is visible, performs a color inversion of the background. This makes the focus border more salient, regardless of the color in the background. Note that browsers are not required to support it. If not, they just consider the statement as invalid

----
####1
**text-decoration-color**
The text-decoration-color CSS property sets the color used when drawing underlines, overlines, or strike-throughs specified by text-decoration-line. This is the preferred way to color these text decorations, rather than using combinations of other HTML elements.
Values -
